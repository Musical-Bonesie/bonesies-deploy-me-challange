# What is this application!?

- A mini challenge I created to help students practice deploying a front-end application via Netlify[https://www.netlify.com/].
- This app is currently designed for 1280 screen.

## Getting started:

- In terminal, navigate into the folder you'd like to house this project in.
- git clone this project.
- npm start your freshly cloned project to make sure it's working how it should.
- Make any changes you'd like (you can also do this after it's deployed as well)!
- Create a GitHub repo for this project.
- Create a Netlify account [https://app.netlify.com/teams/musical-bonesie/overview]

## Get Ready to Deploy!

- Create a Netlify account:
  — Clone GitHub repo project
  — Feel free to make it your own! Add or change something.
  — Create a GitHub repo with for the project.
  -Once everything looks good and you’re ready to deploy it run: npm run build
  -After running npm run build, you should see a lovely build folder appear in your project.

## Next Steps:

- Once you’ve set up your account with Netlify. Click on > _New site from Git_
- Chose GitHub and follow the instructions to connect GitHub to Netlify
- Next pick the GitHub repo you’d like to deploy.
- Make sure the branch you’re deploying from is set to main!
- **For Build Settings:**

- **Base directory:** not set
- _side note_ about Build directory: This is referring to the directory your project is in. So if it’s in a folder called > client it would be “client”. The Default setting is the root of the repository. So in this case you, don’t have to set it.
- **Build command:** npm run build
- **Publish directory:** build
- Hit Deploy (it may take a moment).
- Share your link to show off your deployed app!
